## About

Hello! My name is Gurkirat and I enjoy creating things that live on the internet. My interest in web development started when I was 8 and saw a family-friend create an amazing website using just the notepad.

Fast-forward to today, and I have had the privilege of building and maintaining a whole bunch of Enterprise Management solutions.

Here are a few technologies I've been working with lately:<br />
<ul>
<li>JavaScript</li>    <li>React</li>
<li>Node.js</li>         <li>Firebase</li>
<li>Stripe</li>          <li>GraphQL</li>
<li>AWS</li>            <li>Azure</li>
</ul>
